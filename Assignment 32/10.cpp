/*
10. Create a C++ class for player objects with the following attributes: player no., name,
number of matches and number of goals done in each match. The number of
matches varies for each player. Write a parameterized constructor which initializes
player no., name, number of matches and creates an array for number of goals and
number of matches dynamically.
