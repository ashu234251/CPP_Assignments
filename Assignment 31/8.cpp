/*
8 - In a bank, different customers have savings account. Some customers may
have taken a loan from the bank. So bank always maintain information about
bank depositors and borrowers.
Design a Base class Customer (name, phone-number). Derive a class
Depositor(accno, balance) from Customer.
Again, derive a class Borrower (loan-no, loan-amt) from Depositor.
Write necessary member functions to read and display the details of ‘n’
customers.
